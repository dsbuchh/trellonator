Held Over = patients in a bed at midnight. So when we pick Yesterday as the activity date, this is the patients here when yesterday closed. \nWhy do lots of other non nursing units show with pts? It should only be showing pts for nursing units not ancillary services. Maybe it is doing this bc of the test data? Yes, test data. Someone registered a test patient as inpatient or observation in that unit. \nHow do you get to the details display like in your instruction handout? Double click the number next to Cabell Huntington Hospital or the nurse unit. \nHow would I run a census per unit to  show the current census by unit with the pt detail? Would it be this report?   I will need this type of info for a surveyor real time. This is the report I’d recommend to see today’s census (patient’s held over in bed at yesterday midnight); or you can even run historic dates. You then double click on the number to see the detail. You can also download to excel from within the detail view. \n\nFor the last question, I also recommend checking out ‘Patient Lists’ within Powerchart to gives a real time view of each nurse unit. It’s a few steps to setup your patient list the first time (instructions attached). The good news is you only have to do that once and the list is saved. The next time it’s a simple as opening Powerchart and selecting Patient Lists. \n\nThanks for your help!!!\nDenise\n\n\nFrom: Denise Gabel-Comeau <Denise.Gabel-Comeau@chhi.org> \nSent: Monday, June 15, 2020 8:54 AM\nTo: Derek Buchheit <Derek.Buchheit@chhi.org>; Matthew Orem <Matthew.Orem@chhi.org>; Becky Edwards <Becky.Edwards@chhi.org>\nSubject: RE: [med6][med8] RE: Census Report Request (MED6 - Y JWS CENSUS FOR IN-PAT & OBS)\n\nLooks good in regard  to format.\nWhat does “held over” mean as  the census event?\nWhy do lots of other non nursing units show with pts?

The challenge is we can't simply move the Cerner report to prod as none of the Gold Standard jobs exist in prod. Build data won't correlate to affinity. I had Denise pull me a live Census for a given day from Affinity. From there, in prod I just manually wrote CCL to mimic the Gold Standard extract query.

Keep in mind, it’s just test patient data in this environment; So totals won’t match up with your normal amounts in your current system. \n","dateLastEdited":"2020-03-16T18:04:26.926Z","card":{"id":"5d5d604b5201d71b7cd230bf","name":"[patacct88] Charge/Payment by Department / Provider / Location","idShort":130,"shortLink":"NhO31fcX"},"board":{"id":"5d5e9c026aba7243d0f90ba8","name":"JUMP - Reporting (Complete)","shortLink":"ExM7la3B"},"list":{"id":"5d5d607f6133684ef3ba3e67"}},"type":"commentCard","date":"2020-03-16T18:01:41.976Z","memberCreator":{"id":"5d136f449fee6b774291d8e3","username":"derekbuchheit","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":null,"avatarUrl":null,"fullName":"dsbuchh","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"D","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Derek Buchheit","initials":"DB","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true},"limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":1000,"warnAt":900},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":16}}}},{"id":"5e6fbee6698f556750824f06","idMemberCreator":"5d136f449fee6b774291d8e3","data":{"old":{"desc":"DA2 Report Alias: \n\n- Financial Transaction Summary by Attending, Fin Class, and Payor\n- Transaction Summary by Billing Entity, Provider Specialty and Provider\n- Transaction Detail (Excel)\n\nCCL Program Name: n/a\nBuilt With Application: DA2\nDistribution: DA2\nRun adhoc?

Report Alias: OPIN Charge & Free Drug Admins\nCCL Program Name: n/a\nBuilt With Application: Powerinsight\nDistribution: Powerinsight\nRun adhoc? yes/monthly scheduled refresh\nEstimated Hours to Build:40\n\n**Contact:**\n[Amy Schultz](amy.schultz@chhi.org)\n\n**Recommendation:**\nI would also like to track the white bagging practices in the OPIN for the following medications: Prolia, Fasenra, Remicade, Ocrevus, IVIG, Tysabri, Nucala. I need to pull how many of these drugs were administered on a monthly basis in the OPIN (charted occurrences) and then of the charted occurrences, how many where white bagged (AKA, no pharmacy charge to CHH) So of X number of ocrevus, tysabri, etc infused this month, Y were free drug. Would also like it to report out: date of administration, drug name, dose, frequency, ordering provider, and insurance carrier. Need to track monthly.\n\n**Justification:**\nEmerging changes to medication benefit design are designed to drive patients from the medical benefit to the pharmacy benefit. In a number of these plans, specialty pharmaceuticals are restricted to preferred network pharmacies. If the health system does not have a specialty pharmacy within the payer network, the patient is forced to use the plans own specialty pharmacy OR the preferred pharmacy. this creates a white bagging scenario when the patient wants to have the medication administered in the OPIN here at CHH. White bagging refers to a specialty pharmaceutical being shipped by an off site pharmacy to CHH pharmacy where we administer it in the OPIN. Therefore CHH pharmacy does not purchase the drug or collect the revenue. I would like to be able to track this month to month, to make sure revenue is not slipping out of network unnoticed as the number of white bagging patients is projected to increase by national projections","descData":null,"dueReminder":-1,"idBoard":"5d5e9c026aba7243d0f90ba8","idLabels":["5d5e9c026aba7243d0f90bc1"],"idList":"5d5e9c026aba7243d0f90bac","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":17,"idAttachmentCover":null,"locationName":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"name":"[11587] OPIN White Bagging","pos":98304,"shortLink":"B89f89Xv","isTemplate":false,"badges":{"attachmentsByType":{"trello":{"board":0,"card":0}},"location":false,"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":true,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"checkItemsEarliestDue":null,"comments":7,"attachments":0,"description":true,"due":"2019-10-02T17:00:00.000Z","dueComplete":true,"start":null},"dueComplete":true,"due":"2019-10-02T17:00:00.000Z","email":"derekbuchheit+2sjei4tuwpyivhiv6jn+2t0net8lyzz8h30ww4b+0ym62i61vk@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":[],"idMembers":["5d136f449fee6b774291d8e3"],"labels":[{"id":"5d5e9c026aba7243d0f90bc1","idBoard":"5d5e9c026aba7243d0f90ba8","name":"PROD","color":"sky"}],"limits":{"attachments":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":1000,"warnAt":900}},"checklists":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":500,"warnAt":450}},"stickers":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":70,"warnAt":63}}},"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/B89f89Xv","start":null,"subscribed":true,"url":"https://trello.com/c/B89f89Xv/17-11587-opin-white-bagging","cover":{"idAttachment":null,"color":null,"idUploadedBackground":null,"size":"normal","brightness":"light"},"attachments":[],"pluginData":[],"customFieldItems":[]},{"id":"5d5efed094dbbb38426314f2","address":null,"checkItemStates":null,"closed":false,"coordinates":null,"creationMethod":null,"dateLastActivity":"2020-02-07T16:19:39.234Z","desc":"Alias: Vaccine Administration Fee Rule\nProgram: POC_VACCINE_ADMIN_FEE\nApplication: Discern Rule\nDistribution: Discern Rule\nHours: 40","descData":null,"dueReminder":-1,"idBoard":"5d5e9c026aba7243d0f90ba8","idLabels":["5d5e9c026aba7243d0f90bc1"],"idList":"5d5e9c026aba7243d0f90bac","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":4,"idAttachmentCover":null,"locationName":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"name":"[10914] Vaccine Administration Fee Rule","pos":122880,"shortLink":"miVyizim","isTemplate":false,"badges":{"attachmentsByType":{"trello":{"board":0,"card":0}},"location":false,"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":true,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"checkItemsEarliestDue":null,"comments":0,"attachments":0,"description":true,"due":"2019-08-12T16:00:00.000Z","dueComplete":true,"start":null},"dueComplete":true,"due":"2019-08-12T16:00:00.000Z","email":"derekbuchheit+2sjei4tuwpyivhiv6jn+2suvp9ixxizpiaerdv6+29lhcle64l@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":[],"idMembers":["5d136f449fee6b774291d8e3"],"labels":[{"id":"5d5e9c026aba7243d0f90bc1","idBoard":"5d5e9c026aba7243d0f90ba8","name":"PROD","color":"sky"}],"limits":{"attachments":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":1000,"warnAt":900}},"checklists":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":500,"warnAt":450}},"stickers":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":70,"warnAt":63}}},"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/miVyizim","start":null,"subscribed":true,"url":"https://trello.com/c/miVyizim/4-10914-vaccine-administration-fee-rule","cover":{"idAttachment":null,"color":null,"idUploadedBackground":null,"size":"normal","brightness":"light"},"attachments":[],"pluginData":[],"customFieldItems":[]},{"id":"5d5daf395acd9b1c554d0b0f","address":null,"checkItemStates":null,"closed":false,"coordinates":null,"creationMethod":null,"dateLastActivity":"2020-01-03T16:07:01.144Z","desc":"Alias: DNFB Detail (DNFB-Excel);
